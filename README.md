# PixelKnot
PixelKnot is an Android application designed for secure text hiding within images, utilizing the F5 steganography algorithm for effective data encryption. This tool enables a sender to embed hidden text into an image, which can be sent to a recipient. Only the recipient with the correct password set by the sender can decode and reveal the hidden message. PixelKnot offers a user-friendly interface where users select an image, input the text to hide, and set a password for the encoded image. The app maintains high security and subtle data embedding, ensuring minimal image distortion. Using F5 steganography, PixelKnot combines encryption and compression, making the hidden text challenging to detect without the password. This ensures the privacy and integrity of secret communications within a simple, reliable mobile application.
